## Before I discovered the beauty of coding...

![](glass2.jpg){width="440"}

::: notes
I studied political science, comparative politics and international relations both in my undergrad and grad schools. But I focused my degrees on research using both quantitative and qualitative research methods and gained data analytics and statisticalÂ skills along the way. Besides learning to conduct a research project and analyze the results in STATA during a graduate course, I did not have any background in coding and data science in general.

I never even had an interest in coding or thought it was possible for someone like me, a woman, to have a career in such a field.

When I realized that my plan to become a social science researcher and academic is not working out I decided I needed to jump start my career with a new skill. I've always had an interest in data analysis, so I took an R for Data Analytics program form UCSD extension and came out of the program with RStudio installed on my laptop and knowing how to code print(hello world).

Taking a step back for a moment, there are several options for paths to learn data science, as discussed in the Build a Career in Data Science book and podcast.

## Important things needed in a learning journey

...the most important things in a learning journey and the difficult things to find.

::: notes
In the book/podcast Emily Robinson and Jacqueline Nolis elaborately discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each learning path.

In any learning journey the things you need the most are support and motivation.

They are the most difficult to find when learning a new subject or a new skill on your own.

# Finding a way out

![](glass1.jpeg)

::: notes
Community is a powerful uplifting force during a learning process. But it is usually difficult to find your community during adult professional learning.

For a long while after finishing the R for Data Analytics program I was lost.

I somehow came across the R-ladies community.

Started to join more communities.

And started to leverage those available resources.

Public communities like LinkedIn, Twitter, Mastodon and private communities like the slack channels for R-Ladies, WWCODE, R4DS, and Data Viz Society offer safe learning spaces, collaborative environments, and shared resources. Within such communities I continue to find the support and confidence to progress in my career as a solo data scientist and as an R coder.
